# TODO
- Make a better polybar
- make rofi a bit better use better fonts make rofi a bit transparent
- made a mistake of making terminal a bit too transparent -- maybe a focus mode will work where the wallpaper will go away
- lesson learned never use transparent windows too much that your focus degrades
- check what's mate
- configure neovim for dap
- shifting neovim lsp from nodejs to rust(cargo)
- install some fun cli tools (jp2a, cowsay, neofetch, figlet, fortune)
- rewrite update_github to allow grep filtering and other filters
- A notification system that notifies if a build is complete or if a process is completed in terminal
